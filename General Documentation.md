# Orlando Cart Test 2024 - General Documentation

## Overview
The Orlando Cart Test project revolves around the hypothesis that Mondelez DSD can be more efficient by using a different mechanism for loading and transporting our product. Currently, most DSD facilities load their product on white wood pallets which require electric forklifts or hand jacks to move throughout the warehouse, the back of the truck and throughout the stores. Instead of using white wood pallets, the continuous improvement team has designed warehouse and retail friendly roller carts with the idea that they can be more easily manuevered and thus drive productivity.

The goal of this project is to test whether these roller carts can prove the intial hypothesis that Mondelez can be more efficient when loading and delivering product to DSD customers on carts versus pallets.
